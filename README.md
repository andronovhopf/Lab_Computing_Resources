# Computing principles for scientific researchers 

## Data management
_Principles for storing, organizing, and managing datasets._
- [data organization: organizing data in spreadsheets](https://kbroman.org/dataorg/)- guides for low-level aspects of building a dataset, including naming variables, formatting dates, dealing with missing data, and common errors. Ideal for labs in which part of the team interacts with data through a spreadsheet editor (such as Excel) while others used scripted analyses.





## Software development
_Principles for writing code._
- [Best practices for scientific computing](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001745#s9)- a review of good practices for writing software, such as data processing and analysis scripts.  
- [Good enough practices in scientific computing](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510#sec001) - practical tips for data management, software, collaboration, project organization, and manuscript preparation.
- [Initial steps toward reproducible research](https://kbroman.org/steps2rr/) - a gentle guide for scientists (focusing on R/Python users) to begin writing code that reproduces an entire analysis


## Operations
_Principles for building systems that enable collaboration, transparency, and reproducibility._
- [A practical taxonomy of reproducibility for machine learning research](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=B1eYYK5QgX) - although geared for ML studies, this manuscript gives a solid introduction to what is meant by computational reproducibility and why that is usually not accomplished by sharing code alone. 
- [Computing models for neuroimaging labs](http://www.russpoldrack.org/2019/12/computing-models-for-neuroimaging-lab.html). Russ Poldrack shares pros and cons of various configurations of computing resources in his lab, including cloud computing, an in-house server ("computer in a closet"), and individual workstations. 
- [Git/GitHub guide: a minimal tutorial](https://kbroman.org/github_tutorial/) - written by biostatician Karl Broman about getting started with version control. While it's not the only Git tutorial, this introduces information in a way that makes sense for computational researchers.
