# Computing principles for scientific researchers 

## Papers
- [Best practices for scientific computing](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001745#s9)- a review of good practices for writing software, such as data processing and analysis scripts.  
- [Good enough practices in scientific computing](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510#sec001) - practical tips for data management, software, collaboration, project organization, and manuscript preparation.
- [A practical taxonomy of reproducibility for machine learning research](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=B1eYYK5QgX) - although geared for ML studies, this manuscript gives a solid introduction to what is meant by computational reproducibility and why that is usually not accomplished by sharing code alone.
